    <p>HTML and CSS are known as "frontend" languages.</p>
    <p>This means that you can directly see everything, and although you can't see the code itself, these two languages power the look and feel of a webpage.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="what_you_should_know">
    <header>What You Should Know</header>
    <p>HTML (short for "HyperText Markup Language") is the most basic building block of the web, since it defines the meaning and structure of web content.</p>
    <p>CSS (short for "Cascading Style Sheets") describes the web page's appearance, which makes the web pages look good.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="what_is_html">
    <header>What is HTML?</header>
    <p>HTML can be seen as the "skeleton" of the web page, and this gives the web page some structure.</p>
    <p>The use of tags can be used to define the structure of the page, and without tags, the website wouldn't be able to function properly.<br>Here's some HTML in action:
    <code>
      <header>This is a header, which briefly describes the content</header>
      <p>This is a paragraph, where the content will go</p>
    </code>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="what_is_css">
    <header>What is CSS?</header>
    <p>CSS can be seen as the body (through visual feautures, by defining different aspects, such as eye colour and height), that creates the overall look and feel of a website through the use of a <code>font-family</code> and <code>color</code> for example. Of course, there are more than just fonts and colours:

      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Whilst a page can be fully functional with just HTML, it won't look as visually appealing (unless you're planning on making your website as minimalist as possible).<br>Here's some CSS in action:
      <br>
      <code>
        header {
  color: black;
  margin: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 1.8em;
  font-weight: thin;
}
     </code>

    <header>Creating Your First Webpage</header>
    <p>Creating your first website can be a bit daunting at first, but here's an example of some basic HTML in action:<br>
      <code>
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Welcome to my site</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>A Quick Start on Learning How To Code</h1>
            <p>Learning how to code can be a bit daunting at first, especially if it's your first time doing it and you have no idea what to do.</p>
          </body>
        </html>
      </code>
